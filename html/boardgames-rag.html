                            <p>
                                This project demonstrates the creation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a dataset of popular board games such as <b>Monopoly</b>, <b>Battleship</b>, <b>Ticket to Ride</b>, <b>Codenames</b>, and <b>Exploding Kittens</b>. The goal was to analyze, embed, and generate semantic responses to questions about game rules using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                            <p>
                                The system integrates advanced models such as <b>SentenceTransformer</b> for embedding the rule texts of different board games, followed by dimensionality reduction and clustering using <b>UMAP</b> and <b>K-means</b>. <b>KeyBERT</b> was employed to extract important keywords, while language models like <b>Mistral-7b</b> and <b>Gemma-7b-it</b> were integrated to generate relevant responses based on user queries.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</li>
                                <li><a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face Transformers</a> for text embeddings</li>
                                <li>UMAP for dimensionality reduction and 2D visualizations</li>
                                <li>K-means clustering for semantic structuring</li>
                                <li>KeyBERT for keyword extraction and analysis</li>
                                <li>Mistral-7b and Gemma-7b-it for question-answering</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>UMAP Visualization</h2>
                            <p>
                                After cleaning and pre-processing the rule texts, I split the content into sentences and chunked them into groups. Using <b>SentenceTransformer</b> embeddings, I applied <b>UMAP</b> to reduce the dimensionality of the high-dimensional embeddings and visualize them in a 2D space. This enabled clear representation of the semantic structure across different board game rules.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Clustering and Keyword Extraction</h2>
                            <p>
                                I applied <b>K-means clustering</b> to group the board game rule embeddings, and used <b>KeyBERT</b> to extract representative keywords from each cluster. The clusters and extracted keywords provided insight into the various components of each game's rules.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Language Model Integration</h2>
                            <p>
                                For generating accurate answers to user queries about the game rules, I integrated the <b>Mistral-7b</b> model from <b>GPT4ALL</b> and <b>Gemma-7b-it</b> from <b>Hugging Face</b>. The models were fine-tuned to perform question-answering (QA) tasks specifically tailored to board game rules.
                            </p>

                                <li><b>Model's Answer:</b> There are 8 red agent cards and 8 blue agent cards for each team.</li>
                                <li><b>Truth:</b> There are 8 red agent cards and 8 blue agent cards.</li>

                                <li><b>Model's Answer:</b> A Defuse Card allows you to reinsert an Exploding Kitten back into the Draw Pile in secret, instead of dying.</li>
                                <li><b>Truth:</b> A Defuse Card prevents you from exploding by allowing you to place the Exploding Kitten back into the draw pile anywhere you'd like.</li>
