    <h2>5. Task Implementation</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Sorting Objects by Color</h3>
    <p><b>Process:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Scene Capture:</b> The F200 camera captures an image of the workspace containing various colored objects.</li>
        <li><b>Image Processing:</b> The VLM analyzes the image to detect objects and classify them by color.</li>
        <li><b>Command Generation:</b> Based on the analysis, the VLM generates commands specifying the coordinates and target locations for each object.</li>
        <li><b>Execution:</b> The Mirobot receives the commands and moves each object to its designated location, effectively sorting them by color.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Challenges and Solutions:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lighting Variations:</b> Inconsistent lighting can affect color detection. Adaptive thresholding and color calibration techniques help maintain accuracy.</li>
        <li><b>Overlapping Objects:</b> Objects that are too close or overlapping can be distinguished using depth data from the F200.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Stacking Cubes</h3>
    <p><b>Process:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Scene Capture:</b> The camera captures the initial arrangement of cubes on the workspace.</li>
        <li><b>Object Detection:</b> The VLM identifies each cube's position and orientation.</li>
        <li><b>Stacking Plan:</b> The VLM determines the sequence and positions for stacking the cubes.</li>
        <li><b>Execution:</b> The Mirobot follows the plan, picking up each cube and placing it in the correct position to form a stable stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Challenges and Solutions:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Precision Alignment:</b> The Mirobot's 0.2mm repeatability ensures precise cube placement.</li>
        <li><b>Variable Cube Sizes:</b> The VLM adjusts the stacking plan to maintain balance when cube sizes vary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Arranging Shapes Based on Instructions</h3>
    <p><b>Process:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Instruction Input:</b> The user provides natural language instructions, such as "Arrange the circles in a straight line."</li>
        <li><b>Scene Analysis:</b> The VLM processes the camera feed to detect shapes and their positions.</li>
        <li><b>Plan Generation:</b> The VLM interprets the instruction and formulates a plan to rearrange the shapes.</li>

    <h3>6.2 Custom End Effectors</h3>
    <p>To enhance functionality, the Mirobot can be equipped with specialized tools, including:</p>
    <ul>
