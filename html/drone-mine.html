                            <p>
                                The ongoing conflict in Ukraine highlights the dire need for efficient and safe landmine detection methods. This research explores the use of drones equipped with RGB cameras, multispectral sensors, and ground penetration radar (GPR) to detect landmines. Custom datasets were created using 3D-printed and simulated mines to train machine learning models, particularly YOLO v5 and convolutional autoencoders. While the RGB-based approach showed promise for surface mines, GPR remains essential for buried mines. Additionally, a novel probing technique using simulated robotics in MuJoCo is introduced to enhance subsurface detection. The integration of advanced imaging, AI, and robotic simulations holds transformative potential for landmine detection, improving safety, accuracy, and scalability. This study evaluates the effectiveness of individual technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for future advancements.

                            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                                Landmines pose significant threats long after conflicts end, causing injuries, fatalities, and hindering the use of land for agriculture and development. These hidden dangers necessitate innovative solutions for detection and removal. Traditional detection methods, such as manual searches and metal detectors, face critical limitations, particularly with non-metallic mines. This research explores a modern approach combining drones equipped with advanced sensors, artificial intelligence, and robotic simulations to detect landmines efficiently and safely. Drones offer unique advantages, such as their ability to access hazardous areas without risking human lives, and their adaptability to various terrains and operational conditions. This study specifically focuses on four methodologies: RGB imaging, multispectral sensors, GPR, and robotic probing simulation, each offering distinct capabilities and challenges.

                            <p>
                                Advancements in drone technology and machine learning have catalyzed significant progress in landmine detection.

                            <h3>3.1 Data Acquisition</h3>
                            <p>
                                To ensure realistic testing conditions, simulated mines, including TM-62, PFM-1, OZM, and PMN-2 types, were constructed using 3D printing and materials mimicking real mines' physical and dielectric properties. These replicas were strategically deployed in controlled environments, such as open fields and vegetated areas, to simulate various scenarios. Data collection was conducted using DJI Mavic 2 Pro and Parrot Bluegrass drones, capturing imagery at multiple altitudes (e.g., 10m, 20m, and 50m) and under varying lighting and weather conditions to create a comprehensive dataset.

                            <p><b>RGB Imaging:</b> RGB cameras provided high-resolution images, ideal for surface-level mine detection. Captured data was annotated using Label Studio, a flexible labeling tool, and the YOLO v5 model was trained for object detection. The decision to use YOLO v5 stemmed from its fast inference time and superior performance on small object detection.</p>

                            <p><b>Multispectral Imaging:</b> Multispectral sensors captured data across various wavelengths, revealing details not visible in standard RGB images, such as subtle vegetation disturbances caused by buried mines. Processing these images required optimizing the spectral channel selection to maximize detection accuracy.</p>

                                The YOLO v5 model achieved notable success, with a precision-recall curve indicating robust detection of anti-personnel mines. Despite its effectiveness, the model's accuracy diminished for smaller or partially obscured mines, underscoring the need for dataset expansion and diversity. The RGB-based approach proved cost-effective and relatively easy to implement, relying solely on commercially available drones and cameras.

                            <p>
                                The RGB-based approach is cost-effective and well-suited for detecting surface-level mines but is inherently limited by its dependence on visible features. Multispectral imaging offers a broader detection spectrum but requires significant optimization in both hardware and software. GPR provides unparalleled capabilities for buried mine detection, though it necessitates further refinement to handle complex subsurface environments. The robotic probing simulation introduces a promising new dimension, allowing for safe and scalable subsurface detection through simulated environments.

                            <p>
                                Probing, a method traditionally performed manually by deminers, has been recognized as a reliable but highly dangerous technique for landmine detection. This section explores the automated probing simulation developed using MuJoCo, aiming to enhance safety and efficiency. By leveraging robotic systems equipped with linear actuators, force sensors, and advanced simulation software, this approach seeks to replicate and improve upon traditional methods, reducing the inherent risks to human operators.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Overview of Probing Methodology</h2>
                            <p>
                                Probing involves the careful insertion of a rod into the ground to detect subsurface objects based on resistance feedback. Manual probing requires significant physical effort, concentration, and skill, as even slight miscalculations can lead to triggering explosive devices. The automated probing system replicates this process by using a robotic setup simulated in MuJoCo, a physics-based simulation platform, allowing for detailed experimentation and optimization in a controlled virtual environment.

                                MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) was utilized to design and simulate the probing system. This software provides robust tools for modeling physical interactions, making it ideal for replicating the complex dynamics of probing. Key components of the simulated system include:

                                The simulation demonstrated the feasibility of automated probing for landmine detection. By integrating precise motion control, force measurement, and realistic soil modeling, the system effectively identified subsurface anomalies. While promising, the system's current limitations include the absence of environmental noise and the simplified soil composition in the test bed. Future iterations will incorporate these factors to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment.

                            <h1>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for Landmine Detection</h1>
                            <p>
                                Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a geophysical method used for subsurface exploration, providing non-invasive imaging of underground structures. This technology has proven invaluable for applications such as archaeology, construction, and landmine detection. In the context of humanitarian demining, GPR offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional methods, enabling the identification of buried landmines without direct contact.
